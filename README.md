This is a real business and I am the business owner.

Data Protection Solved.

### **Wireframes:**
The wireframe for this project was built using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). 
The starting point for this process was creating a very basic wireframe for mobile, tablet or laptop.

You can view the wireframes, below:

**Home Page**

**About Us Page**
![About Us html page 2]()

**Contact Us Page**
![Contact Us html page 3]()

### **Colour Scheme:**
The theme of this project is to offer consultancy services, therefore the design choices are 
heavily influenced by professional looking colours and notifs.
The two main colours used are [DimGrey](https://www.htmlcsscolor.com/hex/696969) 
and [White.](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/color_tryit.asp?color=White)

### **Font:**
The [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) font is the main font used throughout 
the whole website with 
[Sans Serif](https://fonts.google.com/?category=Sans+Serif) as the fallback font in 
case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

**Montserrat** is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.


# Features

The features of this website can be broken into groups, namely, existing 
features and features that will be implemented in the future. 
### **Potential Features:**
* Showcase photos, audio and/or video clips from training events. 
* Publicise upcoming training shows and/or availability to speak at events such as conferences and AGMs, etc. ‘Call to action’ is important.

### **Existing Features:**
* The Contact Us form allows the users to contact the business owner.
* Form validation to help with spam attacks.

* Slide out navigations from mobile/tablet navigations.

# Testing

* The wireframes afforded an opportunity to ensure the website layout offered the best of both worlds 
from the point of view of meeting the requirements of the website owner and website users.
* The website was tested throughout the development stage using dev-tools.
* Due to the fact that [Bootstrap5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/) 
was used for this project, it was simple to test the breakpoints.

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were 
no syntax errors in the project. For more details, please see the results below:
