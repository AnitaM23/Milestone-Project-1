### Colour Scheme:
The two main colours used are [DimGrey](https://www.htmlcsscolor.com/hex/696969) 
and [white](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/color_tryit.asp?color=White)

### Font:
The [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) font is the main font used throughout the whole website with 
[Sans Serif](https://fonts.google.com/?category=Sans+Serif) as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. 
Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
